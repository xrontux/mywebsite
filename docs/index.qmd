Fascinated in technological developments, I enjoy reading up about technological
innovations and learning new technical skills. I am a self-motivated individual who
actively seeks new opportunities by stepping out of my comfort zone to challenge
myself on a daily basis. I strongly believe in teamwork, as well as pursuing a value
adding and meaningful career.
